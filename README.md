<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[Mappoâ„¢]() is a straightforward map web application built using [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)'s API, inspired by Google Maps. You may check out Mapbox's GL JS documentation [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/) and obtain an access token to get started using their API [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/).

I started this as a personal mini project to dip my toes into the world of APIs. 

With this app, you can:
* Get your current location, Plan your journeys, Search for and Navigate to places (the way you would with Google Maps!)
* Choose from different methods of travel (Driving, Walking and Cycling) and see how long they would take
* Zoom in and out on the map

Hopefully I'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks in advance!

Head over to or download this repository to get started.
